# Overview


We wrote a language learning app, that has 4 different types of games to learn language. We want people to play games to learn vocabulary and learn how to spell using the game. 

We wrote this software to solve the problem of a lack of learning games for learning languages. We learned C#, and stretched by adding complex games, and making it so that texts from different languages can be copy and pasted into the code in different places in order to easily change the language. We also added timers, randomizers and other things like that to stretch our programming knowledge
